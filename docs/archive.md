	correctness of your code.  

	After PE1, you are expected to write proper documentation in your code, starting 
	with Assignment 4.

	This semester's CS1010 will be conducted in a similar style with the version in 2018. Read [the comments from that batch of students](docs/feedback-1819-s1.pdf) to know what to expect.

    **Explore Some Additional Readings**

	Some extra reading materials curated by Wei Tsang are [available](readings.md).  In particular, check out the articles under _Must Read_ section.  If you have some programming background and are wondering why we are teaching C, read the articles under _Why C_ section.

    **Enable Your Piazza Account**

	You should have received an email inviting you to create a Piazza account and enroll in the module Q&A forum.  Please join CS1010 on Piazza.

    **Enable Your SoC Account**

	Go to https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/~newacct and create your SoC Unix Account if you have not done so.  Activate "General Unix Servers" and "The SoC Compute Cluster" in MySoC here: https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/~myacct/services.cgi

    **Create a GitHub Account**

	Create a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account if you do not have one.  This account should stay with you for your professional career.  So choose the username wisely.

    **Get a Head-Start with Unix and Vim**

	If you did not register for the [SoC Unix@Home Workshop](https://nus-unix-workshop.github.io/2021-s1), you can still head to the website and take a look at the notes and follow through with the examples.
