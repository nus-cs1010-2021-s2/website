# Exercise 0: Echo, Divide, Quadratic

This is your first programming exercise.  An exercise is something that you do on your own.  You can submit them but it will not be graded.   Test cases are provided for the exercises so that you can test and check on your own if your code is correct.  This is in contrast to an assignment, where you need to submit for grading and credits.

### Prerequisite

- You are able to access the [CS1010 programming environment](environments.md).
- You are familiar with [basic UNIX CLI](unix.md) and using terminal-based editor [`vim`](vim.md).

### Learning Outcomes

- Be comfortable writing simple C programs that involve arithmetic operations, `long` and `double` types, and standard I/O.

### One-Time Setup

Before going into their first programming exercise, you need to do a one-time setup of your account on PE. You need to create a file called `.gitconfig` in your home directory and with the following content:

```text
[user]
  name = Your Name
  email = Your Email
[github]  
  user = Your GitHub ID
```

Your email should be whatever you used to sign up Github.

For example, a sample `.gitconfig` looks like this:

```text
[user]
  name = Elsa
  email = queen@arendelle.gov
[github]  
  user = elsasnow16
```

After saving this file, run:

```
git config --get github.user
```

It should return your GitHub user id.

It should print your GitHub user id as already set.  If there is a typo, you need to edit `.gitconfig` again and reload it by repeating the command above.

### Setup

- Click on [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/3GvIvE5X) to accept the exercise.
- Log in to one of the hosts of [CS1010 programming environment (PE)](environments.md)
- Run the following on the command line on one of the PE hosts:

```
~cs1010/get-ex00
```

- You should see a new subdirectory `ex00-<githubid>` in your current working directory, where `githubid` is your GitHub ID.
- We will call this directory your _exercise directory_ or _assignment directory_.

- Inside that directory, you should see a bunch of files:
    - `echo.c`, `divide.c`, and `quadratic.c` are the most important files.  They are the skeleton C code that you should edit to solve the exercise.
	- `inputs` and `outputs` are subdirectories that contain test inputs and test outputs.  We use the convention `problem-name`.`test-id`.in for input test data, and `problem-name`.`test-id`.out for output test data.  So, you will see `echo.1.in`, `divide.1.out`, etc.  The expected output for `echo.1.in` is in `echo.1.out`.  You can look at the content of these files if you wish (which [UNIX](unix.md) command should you use to do this?).  You can edit these files to change the test input and output.
	- `Makefile`: The configuration for the tool `make` that we use to automate the compilation and testing of the programs.  You do not have to understand how to write a `Makefile` for CS1010.  If you are interested to learn how to write a `Makefile`, talk to either Wei Tsang or Google.
	- `test.sh`: A `bash` script for testing your code.  You do not have to edit this file nor call it directly.  It is invoked by `make`.  If you are interested to learn how to write `bash` script, talk to either Wei Tsang or Google.

### Identifying Yourself

In every C file that you submit to CS1010, you need to identify yourself by writing your name and tutorial group.  Marks will be deducted if you fail to do so.  You need to edit the line:

```
@author XXXX (Group YYYY)
```

and change it to something like:

```
@author Elsa of Arendelle (Group B10)
```

### Solving The Assignments

- Edit the files `echo.c`, `divide.c`, and `quadratic.c` to solve the corresponding question as described below.
- To compile and run the given tests with the sample inputs and outputs, run on the command line,

```
make
```

This command will compile both C files. If there is no compilation error, it will run the test scripts.


### Submission

When you are ready, run the following command while you are in the exercise directory:

```
~cs1010/submit-ex00
```

The files `add.c`, `divide.c`, and `quadratic.c` will be uploaded to GitHub.  You can submit multiple times.

### Grading

This assignment is not graded.

-------

## Question 1: Echo

Write a program `echo` (source file `echo.c`) that reads in an integer and print that integer to the standard output.

### Sample run:

```
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./echo
123
123
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./echo
-1
-1
```

The text `ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$` is the command prompt.  Yours will look different, of course.  `echo` is the executable you created.  The next line, `123`, is the input you provide.  Press enter after the input.  `123` is the output printed by `echo`.

## Question 2: Divide

Write a program `divide` (source file `divide.c`) that reads in two integers, $x$ and $y$, and print the value of $x$ divided by $y$.  You can assume that $y$ is never 0.

### Sample run:

```
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./divide
10 2
5.0000
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./divide
1 2
0.5000
```

## Question 3: Quadratic

Write a program `quadratic` (source file `quadratic.c`) that reads in three integers, $a$, $b$, and $c$, that represent the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, and prints its two roots.  Assume that $a \not = 0$ and $b^2 > 4ac$.  Recall that the roots are:

$$
\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Print the root $\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ first on one line,
followed by the other root $\frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ on the next line.

### Sample run:

```
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./quadratic
1 -2 1
1.0000
1.0000
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./quadratic
2 -7 3
3.0000
0.5000
```
