## E-Exam Procedure

We adopt the [E-exam procedure for the School of Computing](https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/academic/e-exam-sop-for-students/) for CS1010.  This is a long document with a lot of information.  Please read through it carefully.  Please set up the software and hardware needed for taking e-exams before the test so that your test-taking experience is as smooth as possible.

Note the following supplementary information to complete the E-exam procedure above, specific to CS1010.

### 2.1 Exam Taking Software

   We will use **Luminus Quiz** for the midterm test.

### 2.2 Proctoring Protocol

   Note that the following applies to CS1010:

   - You are allowed to use only a single screen. If youâ€™re using an external monitor, the laptop screen must be switched off.
   - The browser running Luminuz Quiz running on your PC must be in full-screen mode.   No other tabs are allowed on the browser.

### 2.4. Seeking Clarifications on Exam Questions

   You are allowed to ask clarification questions during the exam.  However, you may only ask a boolean yes/no question.  For instance, you are not allowed to ask "What can we assume about the input?".  You should rephrase it as "Can we assume that the input is always positive?".  Our answers will only be in the form of "yes", "no", "no comment".

### 2.5. Multi-part Exam

   CS1010 midterm is only a single part with no break in between.

## Zoom Session

- There will be only 1 Zoom session and the link will be announced on the day itself via LumiNUS announcements.
- **(New!)** Note that you will definitely need to login to the Zoom meeting from your PC to hear the instructions / ask questions. If you are recording from your phone, you will need to login to the meeting on your phone as well.
- **(New!)** Don't for get to try the setup (video recording / screen capturing) beforehand!
- **(New!)** You should rename yourself to include your tutorial group (e.g., T00 - Zhao Jin) once you have entered the Zoom meeting.

## Invigilators

## Screen Capture Videos

- The screen video captures should be submitted to LumiNUS Files -> Student Submissions -> Midterm Screen Capture Video Submission by the end of the day itself.
